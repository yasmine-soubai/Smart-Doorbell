# Smart-Doorbell
   When the guest presses the button, an image is automatically taken and sent to the owner's email to set it as an archive. A message is also sent to the owner's phone saying that someone is at the door and including a website link. You have to first put the right password to be redirected to the home page of the website. There you can see the picture taken, you can watch a live-streaming of the guest in front of the door, you can communicate with the guest if needed, and you can open the door for him if you decide so.
# Skills needed
   I have used Python programming in the Raspberry pi and worked with HTML and CSS to create the Website. Also some electronics knowledge was needed in this project, and thus I went to talk to a former professor of electronics and passionate in making projects too to get more knowledgeable about this area and thus be able to make my project. I further had to spend some hours in Research to get in touch with the Linus Operating System to program the Raspberry Pi.
